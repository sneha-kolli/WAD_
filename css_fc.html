	<p><i>Music</i> is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies andharmony and which soothes you. Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various <i>musical </i>instruments. A person who knows music is a Musician. The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc.</p>

	<p>The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists in nature. Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? Thus, everything in harmony has music. Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest musicians,“The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.”</p>
